# MATLAB

The purpose of creating this repository is to store all my MATLAB programs at one place. I have written these MATLAB programs over the course of my learning MATLAB. 
These practice programs are from an online course taught by professors of Vandebilt University and offered by Coursera and also from the Mathematical Computing course taken taught at Aalto University
