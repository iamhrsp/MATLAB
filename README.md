# MATLAB

The purpose of creating this repository is to store all my MATLAB programs at one place. I have written these MATLAB programs over the course of my learning MATLAB. 
The problems involve a range of mathematical computations and visualizations, using different MATLAB functions and techniques. These programs are from the Mathematical Computing course taken at Aalto University. I am also taking a course on MATLAB and Data Visualisation from coursera taught by professors of Vandebilt University.
