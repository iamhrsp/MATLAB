# MATLAB

The purpose of creating this repository is to store all my MATLAB programs at one place. I have written these MATLAB programs over the course of my learning MATLAB. 
The problems involve a range of mathematical computations and visualizations, using different MATLAB functions and techniques. These programs are from an online course taught by professors of Vandebilt University on Coursera and also from the Mathematical Computing course taken at Aalto University.
