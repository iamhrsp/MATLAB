## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Linear and Polynomial Fit 
- **Data**: Trajectory of a thrown ball with increasing noise at further distances.
- **Goal**: Fit three models (linear, quadratic, and 4th-degree polynomial) to the data and compute the adjusted \( R^2 \) values for comparison.
- **Key Concepts**: Least-squares fitting, adjusted \( R^2 \), model comparison.

### Problem 2: Statistical Analysis 
- **Data**: Weather data from multiple observers over several years.
- **Goal**: Use ANOVA to test if different observers report common means, and repeat the test by grouping the data by month.
- **Key Concepts**: Analysis of variance (ANOVA), group comparison.

### Problem 3: Fluorescence Lifetime Analysis 
- **Data**: Fluorescence lifetime data of Rhodamine 6G.
- **Goal**:
  - Import and plot the data.
  - Extract segments corresponding to individual decays, fit exponential models to the data, and compute the decay constants.
  - Calculate the mean lifetime based on the fitted decay rates.
- **Key Concepts**: Peak detection, exponential curve fitting, signal processing.

## Techniques Used

- **Curve Fitting**: Applied least-squares fitting for linear, quadratic, and polynomial models.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Tested the significance of means between different groups.
- **Signal Processing**: Extracted peaks and fitted exponential decay curves for fluorescence data.
- **Numerical Computation**: Computed statistical metrics like adjusted \( R^2 \) and mean lifetime from experimental data.
