### 2. Clustering Cars
**Problem Statement**:  
Perform clustering on the `cars.mat` dataset using the following steps:  
1. Extract the first two principal components (PCA).  
2. Perform hierarchical clustering using MPG and displacement.  
3. Compare the clustering results with car origins.  
4. Visualize the clusters in a scatter plot.

### 3. Classifying Satellite Data
**Problem Statement**:  
Classify satellite data using machine learning models:  
1. Implement a KNN classifier for multi-class classification.  
2. Train a pattern recognition neural network for the same dataset.  
3. Compare the results using confusion matrices.

### 4. Concrete Factory Regression
**Problem Statement**:  
Predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques:  
1. Train a linear regression model on concrete composition and age.  
2. Train a neural network (fitnet) for regression on the same data.  
3. Compare the performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
